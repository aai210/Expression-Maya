# Expression-Maya
To use "Expression" you need to select an object, then select coordinates enter Edit/Expression tab

```mel
Selected Object and Attribute: = cos(frame/30);
                               = cos(frame/30)*10;
```
(frame/30) - Is frame rate

(frame/30)*10 - Now the changes will be from -10 to +10
